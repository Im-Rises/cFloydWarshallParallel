## Description

This is a simple program that calculates the prime and twin prime numbers in a given range. It uses the parallel
programming
library MPI to parallelize the calculation.

The Prime algorithm is based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes. The original algorithm from Peter Pacheco for its
book `from Parallel Programming in C with MPI and OpenMP` is modified to work with small ranges and another version to
work with prime numbers.

## Algorithm

The algorithm used to calculate the twin prime numbers is the Sieve of Eratosthenes. It is a simple, ancient algorithm
for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking as composite (i.e., not prime)
the multiples of each prime, starting with the multiples of 2.

```algorithm
1. Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 through n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n).
2. Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.
3. Enumerate the multiples of p by counting in increments of p from 2p to n, and mark them in the list (these will be 2p, 3p, 4p, ...; the p itself should not be marked).
4. Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
5. When the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining not marked in the list are all the primes below n.
```

The algorithm is implemented to count the number of prime numbers in a given range.

### Prime Number Sequential Algorithm

```algorithm
1. Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 through n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n).
2. Initially, let k equal 2, the first prime number.
3. Repeat
   a) Mark all multiples of k between k^2 and n as composite.
   b) Find the first number greater than k in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let k now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
4. When the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining not marked in the list are all the primes below n.
5. Count the number of prime numbers in the list.
```

### Prime Number Parallel Algorithm

```algorithm
1. Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 through n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n). (Each process creates its share of list)
2. Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number. (Each process does this)
3. Repeat
   a) Mark all multiples of k between k^2 and n as composite. (Each process marks its share of list)
   b) Find the first number greater than k in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let k now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3. (Process 0 only)
   c) Broadcast the new value of k to all processes. (Process 0 only)
4. Reduction of the list of primes.
5. When the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining not marked in the list are all the primes below n.
6. Count the number of prime numbers in the list.
```

## Dependencies

- C90 compiler
- CMake
- Makefile
- OpenMPI

## Compilation

To compile the program, you can use the makefile or the CMakelists.txt file.
The makefile is for the GNU compiler collection (GCC) and the CMakelists.txt file is for the CMake build system.

### Makefile build

To compile the program using the makefile, first you need to install the GNU compiler collection (GCC) and the MPI
library.
Then you can compile the program using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install make
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin openmpi-doc libopenmpi-dev
```

Once you have installed the required libraries, you can compile the program using the following command:

```bash
make
```

The executable file will be located in the `buildMakeFile` folder.

### CMake build

To compile the program using the CMake build system, first you need to install the CMake build system and the MPI
library.
Then you can compile the program using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

```bash
cmake -B ${{github.workspace}}/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=g++
```

Once you have installed the required libraries, you can compile the program using the following command:

```bash
cmake -B ./build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

```bash
cmake --build ./build --config Release
```

The executable file will be located in the `build` folder.

## How to use

To use the program, you need to run the executable file and pass the following arguments:

```bash
mpirun -np <number of processes> ./build/cTwinPrimeNumberParallel <upper limit>
```

or

```bash
mpirun -c <number of processes> ./build/cTwinPrimeNumberParallel <upper limit>
```

The program will calculate the prime numbers in the range [3, upper limit].

The twin prime program will count the number of twin prime numbers in the range [3, upper limit].

> **Note**  
> I will not explain how to set up the MPI library for multiple processes from different machines.  
> You can find more information about it in the [MPI documentation](https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/current/).
> You can also find more information about the MPI library in the [MPI tutorial](https://mpitutorial.com/tutorials/).
> The program will only work on your local machine if you use the `mpirun` command with a number of core less than or
> equal to the number of cores of your machine.
